# Group4_Project1_SAD_20232024

## Description 
The increasing number of cars these days has led to a surge in congested parking lots which causes a lot of problems for the users. The main problems include long queues for payment, difficulty to find the empty parking space, Discrepancies of the display system, lack of parking lot signage and finally poor infrastructure in car parking lots. All these problems can take a huge portion of the time of the user causing them to be late, an article states that according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) research, people in Kuala Lumpur spend 25 minutes every day searching for a parking spot (“TimeTec Smart Parking 12/12”, 2021). These inefficiencies not only inconveniences users but also impact parking businesses by deterring customers.
To address the above challenges, we propose a mobile application that streamlines the parking experience. We will be using a “first come first serve” approach which would solve the problem by assigning users the closest available parking spaces upon arrival. This eliminates wasted time searching and minimizes travel time within the lot, offering greater convenience and potentially easier maneuvering upon exiting. The app also has an auto-payment system and is equipped with GPS to guide the user inside the parking lot to easily exit it also alerts the user in case of an emergency or safety issue.
